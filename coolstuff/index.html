    <h1>Media I really like and you should too</h1>
      <p>Here I want to discuss some interesting things you should look into</p>
    <h2>The Sopranos</h2>
      <p>
        So, I just finished The Sopranos and I loved it. So cool. Such
        a cool ending. It was very thought provoking and subverted my expectations.
        The prequel, The Many Saints of Newark, came out recently, but I did not
        really like it. The characters lacked the complexity that made them so 
        interesting on the show. Very much just felt like "hey, remember The Sopranos?". 
        This is not how I want to remember it.

    <h2>Stop Making Sense</h2>
      <p>
        I love this album/movie. It is a live performance by The Talking Heads. 
        It is so energetic, fun, and weird.
        Nearly every song on here is better than their studio version
        counter-parts. There is a life present in these live versions that
        the studio versions can't match.
